# Detection-and-Classification-of-IOT-malware-using-MQTT-dataset

## Project Overview
This project develops and compares various machine learning models to detect IoT malware. The goal is to classify network traffic into six categories: Bruteforce, DoS, Flood, Legitimate, Malformed, and SlowITe. The models used include LightGBM, Random Forest, CNN, Gradient Boost, and Naive Bayes.

## Datasets
- Training Dataset: `train70_reduced.csv`
- Testing Dataset: `test30_reduced.csv`

These datasets contain features used for classifying different types of network traffic.

## Models Implemented
1. **LightGBM Classifier**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
4. **Gradient Boost Classifier**
5. **Naive Bayes Classifier**

Each model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and F1 score.

## Model Performance Comparison

| Algorithm      | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| LGBM           | 90.4%    | 90.1     |
| Random Forest  | 90.6%    | 90.3%    |
| CNN            | 85.8%    | 85.6%    |
| Gradient Boost | 80.1%    | 83.7%    |
| Naive Bayes    | 78.6%    | 75.10%   |

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- LightGBM
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for CNN)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)


## Visualization
After running the script, a bar chart will be displayed showing the comparison between model accuracies and F1 scores:

- Blue bars represent accuracy.
- Orange bars represent F1 score.
